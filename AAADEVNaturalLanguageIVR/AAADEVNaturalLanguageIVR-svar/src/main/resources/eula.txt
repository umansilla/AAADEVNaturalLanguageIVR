This is only a test of the end user license agreement (EULA) mechanism.  
This is NOT an EULA.
If this were a real EULA you would be instructed to read and accept 
the terms prior to installation and/or download. 
Place your EULA in the eula.txt file inside the bundle or snap-in and  
enable your EULA with the following entry in the manifest.xml file 
(also inside the bundle or snap-in):
<component type="eula" filename="eula.txt" />

Before publishing your snap-in, consult with your legal counsel to ensure 
you have an enforceable EULA presentation and acceptance mechanism.
This ends the test of the (EULA) mechanism.
